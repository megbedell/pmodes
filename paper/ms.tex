\begin{abstract}\noindent
% context
Decade-scale surveys taking extreme precision radial-velocity (\EPRV)
measurements provide our best hope for finding and characterizing
truly Earth-like planets around nearby Sun-like stars.
The best \EPRV measurements are not currently limited by photon noise;
they are limited by the intrinsic variability of the target stars.
The simplest kind of variability, in some sense, is the variability
created by the fact that the target stars are, in general, pulsating
in asteroseismic pressure modes (p-modes).
% aims
Here we look at some of the practical and information-theoretic
considerations around different strategies for mitigating p-mode
noise.
% methods
We simulate the p-mode-induced intrinsic stellar surface variability
with a dynamical system that is a forest of modes, each of which is a
damped, driven harmonic oscillator, independently driven by white noise.
We consider p-mode mitigation strategies that involve choosing
sensible exposure times, including fine-tuned exposure times that
(nearly) null the dominant modes, short exposure times that resolve
the modes, and long exposure times that integrate over many mode
periods.
We consider data-analysis methods that treat the measurements as
independent measurements of the stellar velocity (simple chi-squared
fitting) and methods that model the noise as correlated in the way
that the mixture of p-mode contributions should be (kernel or
Gaussian-process methods).
% results
We find that, independent of the choice of exposure time, the
sensitivity of an \EPRV search or characterization project to
small-amplitude planet signals is improved if the data are analyzed
with an accurate p-mode noise model.
Furthermore, we find no advantage, in this data-analysis framework, to
choosing exposure times that are optimal for nulling the p-mode noise.
One limitation of these conclusions is that a good p-mode noise model
requires knowledge of the p-mode spectrum (mode frequencies and
amplitudes) this advocates taking some \EPRV or photometric data on
each target star at short enough cadences to resolve the modes; it's
a small price to pay for \emph{Earth 2.0}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

There are many sources of noise in \EPRV arising from stellar variability on different timescales. 
Modern observing programs are engineered to minimize the contributions of such signals to the final \RV time series.

One significant source of stellar noise in the \EPRV error budget is asteroseismic oscillations, which have a typical amplitude of a few \ms\ for Sun-like stars. 
The default approach to minimize the influence of this signal is purposefully integrating for 10 minutes or more \citep{Dumusque2011}. 
This effectively averages over the (approximately sinusoidal) oscillation signal. 
If the star is bright enough to saturate the detector during a long integration, as a significant number of prime \EPRV targets are, multiple short exposures may be taken and binned. 

More recently, \citet{Chaplin2019} put forward the alternative of setting each target's integration time to be a multiple of the individual star's expected oscillation period. 
This optimal exposure time approach similarly aims to average over the stellar oscillation signal and is more robust in the regime of short exposure times--- for example, as demonstrated by \citet{Chaplin2019} with synthetic stellar oscillation spectra, an exposure time that happens to be 1.5 times the characteristic oscillation period of the star is actually pessimal. 
Thus, when aiming for \RV precision of 0.1 \ms\ and simultaneously trying to observe targets efficiently (\ie not integrating for long periods of time to include many oscillation cycles), an arbitrarily chosen integration time is not sufficient to deal with asteroseismic noise.

There are, however, downsides to integrating over these oscillations. 
Instead we might want to \textit{resolve} and model the asteroseismic signals.

In this work, we use a combination of realistic simulations and actual \EXPRES data to explore the potential benefits of observing strategies for \EPRV which resolve stellar p-mode oscillations. 


\section{Simulated Data}

\begin{itemize}
\item Power spectra used: simple solar-like oscillator with p-modes only and with granulation too
\item (two-panel plot of power spectra)
\item How WF's GP model works
\item Timestamps of observations
\item (two-panel plot of full, noise-free observations)
\item Making these into realistic observations: how we handle binning + noise injections (both photon + read noise)
\end{itemize}

\section{Observing Strategies}

\subsection{Long Exposures}

Test performance of integrating over p-modes. Show that due to stochasticity, an ``optimal'' exposure time isn't always optimal.

\subsection{Short Exposures}

Test performance of resolving p-modes. Say some things about Nyquist limits to motivate choice of exposure times.

\begin{itemize}
\item Functional form of model used
\item Performance in several regimes of read noise/read-out time
\item Does this still work with granulation included?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hybrid Strategies}

???

\section{Validation on Real Data}

\HARPS observations of asteroseismic star -- probably 18 Sco \citep{Bazot2012}.

\section{Discussion}

Recommendations for observers.

Potential limitations -- will other noise sources leak in? Is there any chance that this will bias recovery of planet signals?

Need to know mode spectrum

The possibility that there are Teff variations that are observable.
